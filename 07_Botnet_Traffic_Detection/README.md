# Botnet Traffic Detection and Classification

## 📌 Objective
Built a two-step system to first detect and then classify botnet traffic using a labeled dataset.

## 🔧 Key Tasks
- First model: Detect botnet vs normal traffic.
- Second model: Classify botnet type (e.g., Mirai, ZeroAccess).
- Used Kernel SVC and Deep Neural Networks (DNN).
- Tuned models across 3 iterations.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python, Scikit-learn, Keras  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Files Included
- `botnet_models.ipynb`  
- `confusion_matrices/`  
- `summary_table.xlsx`  
- `report.pdf`

## 🔐 Skills Demonstrated
Cyber threat detection, DNNs, multi-class classification.
